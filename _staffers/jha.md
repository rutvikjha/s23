Hello everyone! My name is Rutvik Jha, and I am a first year CS Masters student in the BS/MS program (BS in Computer Engineering). I previously interned as a Software Engineer at Amazon on Alexa AI and at NVIDIA on TensorRT. I also worked as an Undergraduate Researcher with Professor Beyeler in the Bionic Vision Lab here at UCSB. In my free time, I enjoy running, lifting, and playing guitar. I look forward to helping you all learn this quarter! Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to discuss research, internships, C++ development, course related information, or anything else!
