Hi everyone! I’m Rachel, a sophomore at UCSB studying Computer Science and the co-Director of Instructions at UCSB’s Google Developers Student Club. I like photography, running, and traveling. I’m super excited to spend this quarter with you all. Please don't hesitate to talk to me at all during section or OH, I'm more than excited to answer your questions or comments. I have experience with C/C++, Java, and Python, with a specialization in C++/Python, and will be an incoming SWE intern at SpaceX this summer (also down to discuss the application process with you if you're curious). Happy Spring 2023!
