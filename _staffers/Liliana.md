Hi, I’m Liliana Nguyen! I’m a second-year CS major. A few fun facts about me is that I’m from SoCal, I have a twin sister, and I enjoy playing video games in my free time. Outside of my classes, I'm involved with WiCS (Women in Computer Science) and ERSP (Early Research Scholars Program). This is my second time being a ULA. I’m super excited to ULA for this course, so don’t hesitate to reach out!
